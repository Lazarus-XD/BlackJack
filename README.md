5. The dealer will have to take cards from deck until hand value becomes atleast 17.
6. If the hand value is more than 21 then it is 'bust'. Meaning the other person wins.
7. Whoever has the highest hand value within 21 wins.
8. If the player has hand value 21 at beginning then player wins by blackjack if the dealer's hand value is not also 21. Gets 1.5 times of the bet.
